**Use string methods to make it more user-friendly:**

*e.g.*::
  
  choice.upper()   # makes the 'choice' string upper case

**Using a dictionary to keep track of all the choices you give your reader:**

Using dictionaries: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/dictionary/how-to-use-dictionaries-in-python/

Example: https://github.com/ScienceOxford/intro-to-programming/blob/prep-week-4/week-4/examples/adventure_dictionary.py

**Making a function to call whenever you ask your reader to make a choice:**

*The below example also includes a dictionary.*

**Allow your reader to pick up objects and add them to a list:**

*e.g.*::
  
  inventory.append(item)   # adds 'item' to the end of the list called 'inventory'

**Give your reader health points and track them:**

**Use the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to add lights and sound to the program:**

GPIOzero library: https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

**Use your micro:bit as an input or output to affect your program.**

**Object Orientated Programming**

There is a great (4-week) online course by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to teach object-orientated programming by creating a text-based-adventure game.
If you are reaching the limits of what you can create using the suggestions above, I would highly recommend working through this course!
