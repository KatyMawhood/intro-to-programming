Ideas for projects!
-------------

If you don't have a project in mind already, below are some suggested links and libraries that you may wish to think about.
These are all libraries that I (Sarah) have used in the past, so have *some* experience using.

|

Feel free to make use of anything you can find, but **please send us a link so we can take a look before the session!**

|

**Components**

You may wish to use some physical components in your project, to connect things to your micro:bit for example.

Some components we will have for you to use, others you may need to buy - again, **please send us some info before the session!**

If you want something 3d printed for your project, we need to know in advance, as printing takes time.

You can find pre-created items on https://www.thingiverse.com/

Or design something yourself using e.g. https://www.tinkercad.com/
